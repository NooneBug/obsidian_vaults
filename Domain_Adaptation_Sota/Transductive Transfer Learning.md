Part of the [[Transfer Learning Taxonomy]]
Defined by [[2009 Pan - A Survey on Transfer Learning]]:

In the transductive transfer learning setting, the source and target tasks are the same, while the source and target domains are different. In this situation, no labeled data in the target domain are available while a lot of labeled data in the source domain are available. In addition, according to different situations between the source and target domains, we can further categorize the transductive transfer learning setting into two cases:

	a. The feature spaces between the source and target domains are different. 
	
	b. The feature spaces between domains are the same, but the marginal probability distributions of the input data are different
	
The latter case of the transductive transfer learning setting is related to domain adaptation for knowledge transfer in text classification [23] and sample selection bias [24] or covariate shift [25], whose assumptions are similar
