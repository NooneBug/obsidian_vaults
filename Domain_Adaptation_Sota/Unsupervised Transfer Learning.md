Part of the [[Transfer Learning Taxonomy]]
Defined by [[2009 Pan - A Survey on Transfer Learning]]:

In the unsupervised transfer learning setting, similar to inductive transfer learning setting, the target task is different from but related to the source task. However, the unsupervised transfer learning focus on solving unsupervised learning tasks in the target domain, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation [26], [27]. In this case, there are no labeled data available in both source and target domains in training.
