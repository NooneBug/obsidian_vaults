[[2018 Ramponi - Neural Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in NLP, A Survey]] talks about different definitions for the Domain: 

Despite the formal definition of domain above, the term is quiet loosely used in NLP and there is no common ground on what constitutes a domain [[2016 Plank - What to do about non-standard (or non-canonical) language in NLP]]. Typically in NLP, domain is meant to refer to some coherent type of corpus, i.e., predetermined by the given dataset [[2011 Plank - Domain Adaptation for Parsing]]. This may relate to topic, style, genre, or linguistic register. The notion of domain and what plays into it has though significantly changed over the last years, leading to relevant research lines.

Then describes the differences between two definitions of Domain:

[[Domain Definition - Canonical vs Non-canonical]]

[[Domain definition - Variety Space]]

Describes also some criticities of [[Domain Definition - Canonical vs Non-canonical]] (which can be found in the note)
