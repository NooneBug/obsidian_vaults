From [[2021 Hedderic - A Survey on Recent Approaches for Natural Language Processing in Low-Resource Scenarios]]:

*[[2019 Ruder - Neural Transfer Learning for Natural Language Processing]] named NLP for low-resource scenarios one of the four biggest open problems in NLP nowadays.*

*Tackling low-resource settings is even crucial when dealing with popular NLP languages as low-resource settings do not only concern languages but also non-standard domains and tasks, for which – even in English – only little training data is available. Thus, the term “language” in this paper also includes domain-specific language.*

*This importance of low-resource scenarios and the significant changes in NLP in the last years have led to active research on resource-lean settings and a wide variety of techniques have been proposed. They all share the motivation of overcoming the lack of labeled data by leveraging further sources.*
