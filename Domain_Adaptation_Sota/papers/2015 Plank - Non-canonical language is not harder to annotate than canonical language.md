Describes some differences between Canonical and Non-Canonical language and states that it is wrong to consider Non-Canonical Language more critical than Canonical one.

*One reviewer complained that “the use of Twitter as a corpus might be problematic because of the characteristic use of nonstandard/typical language.” What the reviewer presumably meant is that linguistic annotation of Twitter data is more arbitrary than annotation of standard or canonical language, e.g., newswire. We believe this premise, or prejudice, is false. “Standard language”, as found in newswire and textbooks, for example, is a very biased sample of the linguistic productions in a language community, and the vast majority of the language we process and produce through the course of a day is very different from newswire and textbooks, be it spoken language, literature, or social media text.*

Defines a little why canonical is considered good: [[Canonical Language Definition]]

*We believe some types of non-canonical language pose interesting processing challenges, e.g., with more mixed language, more ad hoc spelling conventions, and more texts directed at smaller audiences with more knowledge required during interpretation. However, newswire also comes with its complexities (headlinese, creative language use, citations, etc.), and if it was not for the skewed distribution of linguistic resources, we do not see why processing social media should be harder than processing newswire*
