Research questions:

First, under what conditions can a classifier trained from source data be expected to perform well on target data? Second, given a small amount of labeled target data, how should we combine it during training with the large amount of labeled source data to achieve the lowest target error at test time?

Most research in machine learning, both theoretical and empirical, assumes that models are trained and tested using data drawn from some fixed distribution. This single domain setting has been well studied, and uniform convergence theory guarantees that a modelâ€™s empirical training error is close to its true error under such assumptions. In many practical cases, however, we wish to train a model in one or more source domains and then apply it to a different target domain.
