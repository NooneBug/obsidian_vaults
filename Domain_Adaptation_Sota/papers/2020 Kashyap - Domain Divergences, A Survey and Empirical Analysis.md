Why are some divergence measures better at predicting drops in performance? The one-dataset one-domain is a key assumption in such works. However, many works have questioned this assumption (Plank and van Noord, 2011). Multiple domains may exist within the same domain (Webber, 2009) and two different datasets may not necessarily be considered different domains (Irvine et al., 2013). Recently Aharoni and Goldberg (2020) show that BERT representations reveal their underlying domains. They qualitatively show that a few text segments from a dataset actually belong to another domain. However the degree to which the samples belong to different domains is unclear
