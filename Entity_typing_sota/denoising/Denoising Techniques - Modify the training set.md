This kind of denoising techniques wants to produce a denoised training set, assuming that the denoised training set will led in a better trained model

First paper to use this techniques in Entity Typing is [[2014 Gillick - Context-Dependent Fine-Grained Entity Type Tagging]]: authors use three rules to denoise the distant supervision annotated training set of [[Dataset - Ontonotes v5]]: [[Denoising Techniques - Gillick 2014 Rules]]
