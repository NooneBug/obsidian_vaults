These models are designed to be robust against noise, so use loss functions which do no optimize on ALL groundtruth types

Models robust to noise are:

[[2016 Ren - AFET, Automatic Fine-Grained Entity Typing by Hierarchical Partial-Label Embedding]],
[[2017 Abishek - Fine-Grained Entity Type Classification by Jointly Learning Representations and Label Embeddings]]
