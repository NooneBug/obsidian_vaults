[[2012 Yosef - HYENA, Hierarchical Type Classification for Entity Names]]: 

*HYENA uses a global threshold θ for accepting to a class. Using a single parameter for all types is not fully satisfying, as different types may exhibit very different characteristics. So the optimal acceptance threshold may be highly type-dependent. To overcome this limitation, we devised a meta classifier that ranks the types for each test mention by decreasing confidence values and then predicts the “right” number of top-n labels to be assigned to a mention, similar to the methodology of (Tang et al., 2009). We use the confidence values of the type-specific classifier ensemble as meta-features, and train a multi-class logistic regression classifier to obtain a suitable value n of features. We combine the base classifiers and the meta classifier by first running the entire ensemble top-down along the type hierarchy, and then letting the meta model decide on how many of the highest-scoring types we accept for a mention.*
