A hierarchical inference method is a inference method that accounts the presence of a hierarchy and produces a prediction which respects the transitivity of the hierarchy (if a type is predicted, then all supertype have to be predicted, or, a subtype can be predicted iff its supertype is already predicted)

It is reported a list of hierarchical inference methods:

The first hierarchical inference method in ET is [[Inference Method - Hierarchical Inference - 2012 Josef]]

Then there are [[Inference Method - Hierarchical Inference - 2015 Yogatama]], [[Inference Method - Hierarchical Inference - 2016 Ren]], [[Inference Method - Hierarchical Inference - 2016 Ma]] which are very similar, but 
	
	- Yogatama fix a maximum number of predictions
	- Ma fix a maximum number of predictions and use a dynamic threshold to stop the inference
