Task proposed by [[2016 Ma - Label Embedding for Zero-shot Fine-grained Named Entity Typing]], consists in classical Entity Typing, but without examples for tested type

Is an extreme case of [[Few Shot Fine Grained Entity Typing]]

[[2016 Ma - Label Embedding for Zero-shot Fine-grained Named Entity Typing]] obtain prototypical embeddings for each type

[[2018 Yuan - OTyper , A Neural Architecture for Open Named Entity Typing]] represent types with word embeddings and learn to project entity mentions close to these embeddings; in this way, the types are not required to be known in advance
