[[2016 Ma - Label Embedding for Zero-shot Fine-grained Named Entity Typing|Ma et al 2016]] is the first paper to propose [[Zero Shot Fine Grained Entity Typing]].

To set up an experiment it took [[Dataset - Ren's BBN]] and [[Dataset - Ren's FIGER]] and partitioned types in seen and unseen.

Seen types were the level-0 one in the hierarchy (the coarse), unseen types were the level-1 in the hiearchy (the fine)

Then, [[2020 Zhang - MZET, Memory Augmented Zero-Shot Fine-grained Named Entity Typing|Zhang et al 2020b]] used the same partition for BBN and FIGER, but also for Ontonotes, its partition of seen and unseen is based on this definition: *unseen types are the leaves, seen types are the other*
