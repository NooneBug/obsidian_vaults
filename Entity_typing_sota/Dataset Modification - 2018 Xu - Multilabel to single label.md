Idea from [[2018 Xu - Neural Fine-Grained Entity Type Classification with Hierarchy-Aware Loss]] in which authors use [[Noise Definition - SIngle Path vs Multi-Path]], assuming that only single path types are to predict and so casting the multilabel entity typing task in a single label task, using the terminal node for each possible single-path and inferring the ancestors after.
