*"We propose a novel method for hierarchical entity classification that embraces ontological structure at both training and during prediction. At training, our novel multi-level learning-to-rank loss compares positive types against negative siblings according to the type tree. During prediction, we define a coarse to-fine decoder that restricts viable candidates at each level of the ontology based on already predicted parent type(s).""*

*"We propose a novel method that takes the explicit ontology structure into account, by a multi-level learning to rank approach that ranks the candidate types conditioned on the given entity mention. Intuitively, coarser types are easier whereas finer types are harder to classify: we capture this intuition by allowing distinct margins at each level of the ranking model"*

The approach has this architecture:

Mention encoder: similar to the [[2019 Lin - An Attentive Fine-Grained Entity Typing Model with Latent Type Representation| 2019 Lin one]] a 
	- mention representation is derived using the representations of the words in the mention. A max pooling layer is applied atop the mention after a linear transformation
	- context representation is generated by attending the sentence with a query vector derived from the mention vector m (???)
	
A type embedding is learned for each type, so this is a [[Models with Type Representations | Model with Type Representations]] and the similarity is computed with dot product.

This method has a an [[Hierarchy Representation 2020 Chen | internal hierarchy representation]]

The inference is simple: given the ranking, top-k elements are added to a q; each type is added to the predicted type set only if it is ranked higher than its supertype (not clear how supertypes can be inferred, maybe starting from the inferred subtypes). This method produce both [[Predictions - Single Path Prediction]] ans [[Predictions - Multiple Path Precition]] and [[Predictions - Partial Path Prediction]]

ComplEx is used to initialize type representation

The approach is evaluated on AIDA, [[Dataset - Ren's BBN]][[Dataset - Ren's Ontonotes]][[Dataset - Ren's FIGER]]
