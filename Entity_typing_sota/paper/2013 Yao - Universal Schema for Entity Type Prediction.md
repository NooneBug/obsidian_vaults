From abstract : 
This paper presents a universal schema approach to fine-grained entity type prediction. The set of types is taken as the union of textual surface patterns (e.g. appositives) and pre-defined types from available databases (e.g. Freebase)â€”yielding not tens or hundreds of types, but tens of thousands of entity types, such as financier, criminologist, and musical trio

It is not clear how they use the types to solve entity typing
