Describe the entity with different sources (representation metaview):

*Our key idea is that we can tap two different information sources for entity typing, which we will refer to as metaviews: language and representation. For the language metaview, we consider N languages (English, German, . . . ). For the representation metaview, we consider three representations: based on the entityâ€™s context distribution, based on its canonical name and based on its description. Each combination of language and representation defines a separate view of the entity, i.e., we have up to 3N views. The views are not completely independent of each other: what is written about an entity in English and German is correlated and information derived from the entity name is correlated with its description;*

Because of this aspect, this work is very different from all other works
