"*In this paper, we study the new problem of fine-grained chemical entity typing, which poses interesting new challenges especially because of the complex name mentions frequently occurring in chemistry literature and graphic representation of entities. We introduce a new benchmark data set (CHEMET) to facilitate the study of the new task and propose a novel multi-modal representation learning framework to solve the problem of fine-grained chemical entity typing by leveraging external resources with chemical structures and using cross-modal attention to learn effective representation of text in the chemistry domain*"

So this is not related with classical Fine Grained Named Entity Typing
