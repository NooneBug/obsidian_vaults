First paper to explicitly define "context dependent entity typing" i.e. where the set of acceptable labels for a mention is restricted to only those deducible from the local context (e.g. sentence or document).

The authors propose a new dataset for fine grained entity typing: [[Dataset - Ontonotes v5]]

This is the first paper that try to apply [[Denoising Techniques - Modify the training set]] on the training set [[Denoising Techniques - Gillick 2014 Rules]]
