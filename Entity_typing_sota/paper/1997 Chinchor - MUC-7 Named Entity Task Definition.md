Task definition in the MUC-7

Like [[1995 Sundheim - Entity Task Definition (MUC-6)]] defines NET together with NER:  
"The task is to identify all instances of the three types of expressions  
in each text in the test set and to subcategorize the expressions"  
The input sentences are plain, the "subcategories" are predetermined:  
entities (organizations, persons, locations), times (dates, times), and quantities (monetary values, percentages

Maintain the same types of [[1995 Sundheim - Entity Task Definition (MUC-6)]]
