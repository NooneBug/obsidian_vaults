[[1997 Bortwick - . Description of the MENE Named Entity System as Used in MUC-7]] defines a lot of features, use maximum entropy and rules and also adopts feature selection

[[2001 Fleischman - Automated Subcategorization of Named Entities]] defines 11 features for each token in the input

[[2002 Fleischman - Fine Grained Classification of Named Entities]] uses features to describe the input

[[2010 Rahman - Inducing Fine-Grained Semantic Classes via Hierarchical and Collective Classification]]

[[2012 Ling - Fine-Grained Entity Recognition]]

[[2014 Gillick - Context-Dependent Fine-Grained Entity Type Tagging]]
