To encode an entity mention within its sentence Sentence Splitting is introduced by [[2015 Dong - A Hybrid Neural Model for Type Classification of Entity Mentions]]

A sentence is splitted in : 
		
	- Left Context  : the words before the mention (can be void)
	- Mention : the words of the mention        (cannot be void)
	- Right Context : the words after the mention  (can be void)
