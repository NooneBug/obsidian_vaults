A Ranking loss is a loss adopted in regression (logistic) methods, in order to not force the predicted vector to be as similar as possible to the one of correct types but to ensure that the most similar types are the correct ones.

This loss is less strict than a distance based loss and is very useful for multilabel problems, since it do not force all correct labels to be the same vector (which is an non-optimal configuration given a dataset)
