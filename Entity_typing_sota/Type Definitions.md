From [[1995 Sundheim - Entity Task Definition (MUC-6)]]

For each tag (ENAMEX, TIMEX, NUMEX) are defined some subtypes

For ENAMEX, the TYPE value can be ORGANIZATION, PERSON, or LOCATION; for TIMEX, the TYPE value can be DATE or TIME; and for NUMEX, the TYPE value can be MONEY or PERCENT.

There is a hierarchy with 3 tags on top and 7 types
