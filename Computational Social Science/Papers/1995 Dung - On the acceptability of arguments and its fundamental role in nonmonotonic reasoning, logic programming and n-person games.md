- We develop a theory for argumentation in which the acceptability of arguments is precisely defined. 
- We show that logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning in AI are different forms of argumentation. 
- We show that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure. 

This result introduces a general method for generating metainterpreters for argumentation systems.
