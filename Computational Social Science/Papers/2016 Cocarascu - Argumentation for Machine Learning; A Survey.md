Existing approaches using argumentation for ML differ in the type of ML they consider and the specific method they use. Concretely:

- the Argumentation-Based Machine Learning (ABML) approach of [32] extends the CN2 rule induction algorithm [12] for supervised learning; 
- the Argument-Based Inductive Logic Programming (ABILP) approach of [4] extends Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for supervised learning;
- the hybrid approach of [21] uses as its starting point the Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) model [7] for unsupervised learning
- the fully argumentative concept learning method of [1] focuses on the version space learning framework [27] for supervised learning;
- the multi-agent inductive concept learning of [34] and its computational realisation [35] have concept learning [27] for supervised learning as their starting point;
- the Argumentation Accelerated Reinforcement Learning (AARL) of [17,18,19] extends SARSA [39] for reinforcement learning;
- the Classification enhanced with Argumentation (CleAr) method of [8,9] works with any supervised learning technique, and has been experimented with, in particular, Na¨ıve Bayes classifiers [25], Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [13] and Random Forests [5].

Moreover, existing approaches differ in their use of argumentation and in their choice of argumentation framework/method. Finally, different approaches achieve different (desirable) outcomes, ranging from improving performances to rendering the ML process more transparent by improving its explanatory power
