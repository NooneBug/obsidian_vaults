Definizione precisa di semantics in AF/BAF
	**Bing:** [In an **Argumentation Framework**, semantics is a formal way to determine which arguments can be considered justified given the conflicts among a set of arguments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370207000744). An extension-based argumentation semantics is defined by specifying the criteria for deriving a set of extensions, where each extension represents a set of arguments considered to be acceptable together.

Cos'è un extension su un AF/BAF?
	**Bing:** An **extension** in an Argumentation Framework represents a set of arguments that are collectively acceptable. Dung distinguishes several types of admissible sets called extensions, which express different perspectives on arguments that are collectively acceptable. [Examples of extensions are preferred, stable, complete, or grounded extensions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020019022001119).

How the acceptability of an argument is established?
	- **Bing:** The acceptability of an argument is established within the context of an **Argumentation Framework**. [Acceptability is a value an argument obtains in the context of an argumentation framework](https://ivanjureta.com/economics-of-the-acceptability-of-an-argument/). The aim of an argument framework is to evaluate the acceptability (or the relevance) of groups of arguments. [Dung distinguishes several types of admissible sets called extensions, which express different perspectives on arguments that are collectively acceptable](https://bing.com/search?q=acceptability+of+an+argument+in+argumentation+framework).
