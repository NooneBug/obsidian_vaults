Collection of arguments that can defend themselves against attack, called acceptance set.

Defined by [[1995 Dung - On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role in nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming and n-person games|1995 Dung]] in the context of abstract argumentation, clear definitions on [[2020 Baroni - On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role in nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming and n-person games - 25 years later|2020 Baroni]]

Example:

Given three arguments $P, Q,$ and $R$, with the following relations: $P$ and $R$ supports each other, $Q$ attacks $P$ and $R$ defends $P$ against $Q$: 
- The set consisting of the arguments $P$ and $R$ is admissible since $P$ and $R$ do not attack each other (or themselves) and $R$ defends $P$ against the attack by $Q$. 
- The set consisting of only $P$ is not admissible since there is no defence against $Q$
- The set consisting of $P$ and $Q$ is not since $Q$ attacks $P$.
