The online version of ChatGPT is used (28/06/2023)

For each dataset entry to answer the following procedure is used:

- Create a new chat instance
- Traduce the plain text into the prompt
- Input the prompt in the chat UI
- Pick the answer `Answer 1`
- Use the button "regenerate answer" to obtain `answer 2` and `answer 3`

The experiment cannot be repeated with exact same answers since the internal state of ChatGPT is not parametrized
