Given this sentence: "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these treatments on health-related quality of life (HQL). Men with metastatic prostate cancer (n = 161) were randomized to receive either daily prednisone alone or mitoxantrone (every 3 weeks) plus prednisone. Those who received prednisone alone could have mitoxantrone added after 6 weeks if there was no improvement in pain. HQL was assessed before treatment initiation and then every 3 weeks using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14), a trial-specific module developed for this study. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to determine the mean duration of HQL improvement and differences in improvement duration between groups of patients. At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains, and only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group. After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01), and the improvement (> 10 units on a scale of 0 to100) lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group (.004 < P <.05). The addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life (.001 < P <.003). Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone." Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". There exists a relation (support or attack) between claim 1 and claim 2 (answer with support, attack, or none if not exists)

1) The provided information supports claim 2 ("Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone"). The study states that patients receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life, functioning domains, and symptoms compared to those receiving prednisone alone. The improvement in health-related quality of life (HQL) scores lasted longer and was greater in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group. Therefore, claim 2 is supported by the information given.
2) **There is a relation of support between claim 1 and claim 2.** The evidence provided in the given text supports the idea that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, the text states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. **Therefore, claim 2 supports and reinforces claim 1.**
3) **There exists support between claim 1 and claim 2**. Claim 1 states that a combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for the reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. The provided information in the sentence indicates that the addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after the failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life. This supports the idea that the combination treatment (mitoxantrone plus prednisone) is more effective in reducing pain compared to prednisone alone. Claim 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. The given sentence also mentions that the patients taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life, functioning domains, and symptoms, and these improvements lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group. This information supports claim 2, indicating that the combination treatment has a greater and longer-lasting impact on HQL domains and symptoms compared to prednisone alone. Therefore, claim 2 is supported by the information provided and is consistent with claim 1.
