Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". There exists a relation (support or attack) between argument 1 and argument 2 (answer with support, attack, or none if not exists)

---

1) Attack: The two arguments contradict each other as they cannot be true at the same time.
2) Attack: The results of the study suggest that there is no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of improving HQL domains at 6 weeks. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that one treatment is better than the other based on this particular outcome measure.
3) Support. The first argument provides evidence that both groups improved at 6 weeks, while the second argument suggests that one group had greater and more sustained improvement compared to the other. Therefore, there is some level of association between the two arguments.
