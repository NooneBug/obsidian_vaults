Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". There exists a relation (support or attack) between argument 1 and argument 2 (answer with support, attack, or none if not exists)

---

1) Based on the given arguments, **there is a support relation between argument 1 and argument 2**. Argument 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several Health-Related Quality of Life (HQL) domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone. Argument 1 provides additional support for argument 2 by stating that at 6 weeks, both groups (presumably the mitoxantrone plus prednisone group and the prednisone alone group) showed improvement in several HQL domains. This indicates that both treatments had a positive effect on HQL domains at 6 weeks. Therefore, argument 1 supports the notion that both treatments led to improvement in HQL domains, and argument 2 builds upon that by highlighting that the group receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone experienced even greater and longer-lasting improvement compared to the prednisone alone group.
2) **The two arguments provided are related, and the relation between them is support**. Argument 1 states that at 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains. This indicates that both treatments, mitoxantrone plus prednisone and prednisone alone, had some positive impact on HQL domains. Argument 2 builds upon this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. This argument provides further support to the initial statement in argument 1, suggesting that the combination treatment had more significant and enduring benefits in improving HQL domains and symptoms compared to prednisone alone. Therefore, argument 2 supports the findings mentioned in argument 1, reinforcing the notion that the combined treatment had a superior impact on HQL domains and symptoms.
3) **The arguments provided suggest a supportive relationship between Argument 1 and Argument 2.** Argument 1 states that both groups showed improvement in several Health-Related Quality of Life (HQL) domains at 6 weeks. This implies that both treatment groups (mitoxantrone plus prednisone and prednisone alone) had positive outcomes in terms of HQL improvement. Argument 2 further expands on this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. This indicates that the combination treatment yielded superior results in terms of HQL improvement and symptom management. Therefore, Argument 2 builds upon Argument 1 by highlighting the enhanced efficacy of the mitoxantrone plus prednisone treatment, thereby supporting the initial statement that both treatment groups showed improvement in HQL domains.
