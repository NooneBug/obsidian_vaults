Given this sentence: "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these treatments on health-related quality of life (HQL). Men with metastatic prostate cancer (n = 161) were randomized to receive either daily prednisone alone or mitoxantrone (every 3 weeks) plus prednisone. Those who received prednisone alone could have mitoxantrone added after 6 weeks if there was no improvement in pain. HQL was assessed before treatment initiation and then every 3 weeks using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14), a trial-specific module developed for this study. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to determine the mean duration of HQL improvement and differences in improvement duration between groups of patients. At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains, and only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group. After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01), and the improvement (> 10 units on a scale of 0 to100) lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group (.004 < P <.05). The addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life (.001 < P <.003). Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone." Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". There exists a relation (support or attack) between argument 1 and argument 2 (answer with support, attack, or none if not exists)

1) **There exists support between argument 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains" and argument 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone."** The first argument establishes that both treatment groups experienced improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains after 6 weeks. This implies that both treatments had some positive effect on HQL. The second argument builds upon the first by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in even greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. This suggests that the combination of mitoxantrone and prednisone was more effective in improving HQL than prednisone alone. Therefore, argument 2 supports and extends the findings of argument 1 by highlighting the superior effectiveness of the mitoxantrone plus prednisone combination in improving HQL domains and symptoms.
2) **The arguments provided are supportive of each other:** Argument 1 states that at 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains. This indicates that both treatments, prednisone alone and mitoxantrone plus prednisone, had some positive impact on HQL domains after 6 weeks of treatment. Argument 2 builds upon this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. This suggests that the addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone resulted in more significant and sustained improvements in HQL domains and symptoms. Therefore, argument 2 supports argument 1 by indicating that the group receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone experienced superior and longer-lasting improvements in HQL domains and symptoms compared to the group receiving prednisone alone.
3) **The two arguments provided can be considered supportive of each other.** Argument 1 states that at 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains. Argument 2 builds upon this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Therefore, argument 2 supports argument 1 by providing additional evidence that the group receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone had superior improvement in HQL domains and symptoms, indicating that this combination treatment is more effective than prednisone alone.
