Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". There exists a relation (support or attack) between claim 1 and claim 2 (answer with support, attack, or none if not exists)

1) **Support**. The second claim provides evidence that supports the first claim by showing that the combination therapy resulted in better outcomes on various health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains compared to prednisone alone.
2) This question requires knowledge beyond just reading comprehension, as it involves understanding medical terminology and research studies. The answer would require analyzing the data from the study being referred to and determining whether there is evidence to support or refute each claim. Without access to that information, I cannot provide an accurate response.
3) * Relation: **Support**
    Reasoning: Claim 1 suggests that mitoxantrone plus prednisone is more effective than prednisone alone in reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. Claim 2 supports this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Therefore, there is a relationship of support between these two claims.
