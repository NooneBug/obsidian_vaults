Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the argument 1 supporting argument 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) **True.** Argument 1 supports argument 2. The first argument states that both groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains at 6 weeks. The second argument builds upon this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Therefore, argument 1 provides evidence for the superiority of the mitoxantrone plus prednisone treatment mentioned in argument 2.
2) **True.** Argument 1 supports argument 2.
3) **False.** Argument 1 states that at 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains. It does not specifically mention which group (mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisone alone) showed greater or longer-lasting improvement. Argument 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. This argument presents a specific comparison between the two treatments and indicates that the group receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone had superior outcomes. Since argument 1 does not specify the superiority of one treatment over the other, it does not directly support argument 2.
