Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the argument 1 supporting argument 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) **Answer: True.** The first statement provides evidence that both groups improved at 6 weeks, which supports the second statement's claim that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in greater improvement compared to prednisone alone.
2) **Answer: True.** Argument 1 provides evidence that both groups improved at 6 weeks, which supports the idea that there is a difference between the two treatments.
3) **Answer: True.** Argument 1 provides evidence that both groups improved at 6 weeks, which supports the idea that there is a difference between the two treatments.
