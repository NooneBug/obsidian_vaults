Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the claim 1 **supporting** claim 2 (answer with true or false)?

---

1) Answer: **False**. The first claim does not necessarily support the second claim. While it may be true that a combination therapy can lead to better outcomes compared to monotherapy, this does not mean that all combinations will result in improved outcomes. It depends on various factors such as patient characteristics, disease severity, drug interactions, etc. Therefore, we cannot assume that because one combination therapy works well, another similar combination therapy will also work well.
2) The answer should be **False** because claim 1 does not mention anything about health-related quality of life (HQL). Therefore, it cannot support a claim that mentions HQL.
3) Answer: **False**. Claim 1 states that a combination therapy of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is more effective than prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. This does not necessarily mean that this combination therapy will lead to greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to prednisone alone as stated in claim 2. Therefore, the two claims are not directly related and cannot be used to support each other.
