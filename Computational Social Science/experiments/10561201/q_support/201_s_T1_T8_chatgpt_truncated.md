Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the claim 1 **supporting** claim 2 (answer with true or false)?

1) **True**. Claim 1, stating that "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer," supports Claim 2, which states that "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone." Both claims suggest that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is more effective in reducing pain and improving health-related quality of life compared to treatment with prednisone alone.
2) **True**. Claim 1, stating that a combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for pain reduction in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer, supports claim 2. Claim 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone leads to greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Since claim 1 establishes the superiority of the combination therapy over prednisone alone in terms of pain reduction, it aligns with the broader claim 2 regarding overall improvement in HQL domains and symptoms.
3) **True**. Claim 1 states that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Claim 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone leads to greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Since claim 2 mentions a broader range of benefits beyond pain reduction, it can be inferred that claim 1 supports claim 2.
