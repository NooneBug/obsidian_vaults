Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the claim 1 attacking claim 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) **False**. Claim 1 is not attacking claim 2. The two claims are related and support each other. Claim 1 states that a combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Claim 2 further supports this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone leads to greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Therefore, the two claims are aligned in their support for the combination treatment.
2) **False.** Claim 1 is not attacking claim 2. The two claims are related and complementary, rather than contradictory or conflicting with each other. Claim 1 suggests that a combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Claim 2, on the other hand, states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone leads to greater and longer-lasting improvement in various health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. Both claims support the effectiveness of the combination therapy, but claim 2 provides additional information about its broader impact on patients' well-being beyond pain reduction.
3) **False**
   Claim 1 states that a combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. This claim is focused specifically on pain reduction.
   Claim 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone is associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. This claim is broader and encompasses various aspects of quality of life and symptoms, not just pain reduction.
   Therefore, claim 1 is not attacking claim 2. They are addressing different aspects of treatment effectiveness in metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer.
