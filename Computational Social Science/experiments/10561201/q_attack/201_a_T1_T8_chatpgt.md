Given this sentence: "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these treatments on health-related quality of life (HQL). Men with metastatic prostate cancer (n = 161) were randomized to receive either daily prednisone alone or mitoxantrone (every 3 weeks) plus prednisone. Those who received prednisone alone could have mitoxantrone added after 6 weeks if there was no improvement in pain. HQL was assessed before treatment initiation and then every 3 weeks using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14), a trial-specific module developed for this study. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to determine the mean duration of HQL improvement and differences in improvement duration between groups of patients. At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains, and only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group. After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01), and the improvement (> 10 units on a scale of 0 to100) lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group (.004 < P <.05). The addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life (.001 < P <.003). Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone." Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the claim 1 attacking claim 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) False. The claim 1 is not attacking claim 2.
2) False. The two claims are not attacking each other. They both present findings from the study but focus on different aspects. Claim 1 states that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for the reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Claim 2 states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone is associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. These claims are complementary rather than contradictory.
3) False. Claim 1 is not attacking claim 2. Claim 1 states that a combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Claim 2, on the other hand, states that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone is associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. These two claims are complementary rather than contradictory. Claim 1 focuses specifically on pain reduction, while claim 2 encompasses a broader range of improvements in HQL domains and symptoms.
