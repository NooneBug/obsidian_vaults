Given the claims: 1) "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer." and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the claim 1 attacking claim 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) Answer: **False**. Claim 1 is not necessarily attacking claim 2. The two claims are addressing different aspects of the same intervention - one focuses on pain reduction while the other focuses on overall health-related quality of life improvements. Therefore, **it is possible that both claims could be true at the same time**.
2) Answer: **False**. Claim 1 is not necessarily attacking claim 2 as there could be other studies that support both claims. However, if we assume that these are the only two claims being discussed, **then it can be said that claim 2 supports claim 1** by providing evidence for the effectiveness of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in reducing pain in patients with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer.
3) This question requires careful reading and analysis of both claims before answering. Claim 1 suggests that a specific treatment regimen - mitoxantrone plus prednisone - is more effective than prednisone alone for reducing pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. Claim 2, on the other hand, makes general statements about the benefits of treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone, including improvements in health-related quality of life (HQL). Therefore, it can be concluded that **claim 1 does not necessarily attack claim 2**. While claim 1 focuses specifically on the effectiveness of mitoxantrone plus prednisone for reducing pain, claim 2 provides broader information about the overall impact of this treatment regimen on HQL.

4. Which statement best describes the relationship between power and effect size?
    A. Power = sample size / effect size
    B. Effect size = power x sample size
    C. There is no relationship between power and effect size
    
5. What is the main purpose of randomization in clinical trials?
    A. To ensure that participants are similar at baseline
    B. To minimize selection bias
    C. To control for confounding variables
    
6. If a study reports p values less than 0.05, what does this mean?
    A. The results are statistically significant
    B. The results are not statistically significant
    C. The study did not measure statistical significance
    
7. Which type of study design involves comparing two groups who receive different treatments but there is no attempt to control for potential confounders?
    A. Quasi-experimental design
    B. Randomized controlled trial
    C. Observational study
    
8. In a randomized controlled trial, what is the primary outcome measure?
    A. Intention-to-treat analysis
    B. Per-protocol analysis
    C. Analysis of all patients enrolled
    
9. What is the most common reason for missing data in clinical studies?
    A. Participants dropping out due to adverse events
    B. Lack of funding for follow-up assessments
    C. Poor recruitment strategies
    
10. What is the role of blinding in clinical trials?
    A. To prevent participants from knowing which treatment they received
    B. To prevent researchers from knowing which treatment participants received
    C. To prevent participants from receiving any treatment at all
    
11. What is the main advantage of using meta-analysis over individual studies?
    A. It allows for smaller sample sizes to be used
    B. It increases the risk of bias and confounding factors
    C. It provides more precise estimates of effect size
    
12. What is the main purpose of conducting sensitivity analyses in clinical trials?
    A. To test the robustness of the results
    B. To identify potential sources of bias or confounding
    C. To provide an estimate
