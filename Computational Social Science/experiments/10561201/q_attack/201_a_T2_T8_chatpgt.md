Given this sentence: "A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these treatments on health-related quality of life (HQL). Men with metastatic prostate cancer (n = 161) were randomized to receive either daily prednisone alone or mitoxantrone (every 3 weeks) plus prednisone. Those who received prednisone alone could have mitoxantrone added after 6 weeks if there was no improvement in pain. HQL was assessed before treatment initiation and then every 3 weeks using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14), a trial-specific module developed for this study. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to determine the mean duration of HQL improvement and differences in improvement duration between groups of patients. At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains, and only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group. After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01), and the improvement (> 10 units on a scale of 0 to100) lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group (.004 < P <.05). The addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life (.001 < P <.003). Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone." Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the argument 1 attacking argument 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) **False. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2**. The two arguments are complementary, providing additional information about the effects of the treatments on health-related quality of life (HQL). Argument 1 states that both treatment groups showed improvement in several HQL domains at 6 weeks, while argument 2 highlights that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. These arguments are not contradictory but rather support the overall conclusion that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is more effective for improving HQL in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
2) **False. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2.** The two arguments are not contradictory; rather, they provide complementary information. Argument 1 states that both treatment groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains after 6 weeks. Argument 2 adds to this by stating that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to treatment with prednisone alone. These arguments are not in conflict but rather support the overall conclusion that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable for improving HQL in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer.
3) **False. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2.**
