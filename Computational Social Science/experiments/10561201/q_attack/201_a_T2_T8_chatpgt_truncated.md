Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the argument 1 attacking argument 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) **False**. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2.
2) **False**. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2. It simply states that both groups showed improvement in several health-related quality of life (HQL) domains at 6 weeks. It does not make any direct comparison or contradiction to the findings mentioned in argument 2.
3) **False**. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2. The first argument simply states that both treatment groups showed improvement in several Health-Related Quality of Life (HQL) domains at 6 weeks. It does not make any comparison or contradiction with the second argument. The second argument compares the two treatments and states that the combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone led to greater and longer-lasting improvement in HQL domains and symptoms compared to prednisone alone. There is no attack or contradiction between the two arguments based on the information provided.
