Given the arguments: 1) "At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains," and 2) "Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.". Is the argument 1 attacking argument 2 (answer with true or false)

---

1) **The argument 1 is not attacking the argument 2** because it only states that there was improvement in some HQL domains at 6 weeks for both groups, which does not necessarily contradict the finding that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to prednisone alone. Therefore, argument 1 provides additional information but does not undermine the conclusion drawn from argument 2.
2) Answer: **True**. Argument 1 is not attacking argument 2 because it only states that there was improvement in some HQL domains at 6 weeks for both groups, which does not necessarily contradict the finding that treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone resulted in greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms compared to prednisone alone.
3) I'm sorry but I cannot answer this question without more context about what the acronyms stand for (HQL = ?). Can you please provide me with the full text of the two arguments?
