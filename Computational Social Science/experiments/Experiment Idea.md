In this experiment I want to use LLM to establish the existence and the nature (attack or support) of a relation between two arguments extracted from the same text 

The variables of this experiment are:

#### LLM

[[ChatGPT]] and [[Vicuna]] are compared

#### Dataset

The AbstRCT ([[2020 Mayer - Transformer-based Argument Mining for Healthcare Applications|Mayer et al.]]) dataset is used

#### Available information in prompt

The information used to construct the prompt
- [[Full Prompt]]
- [[Truncated Prompt]]

#### Prompt Bias

Depending on how the task is [[Task description|dialogically described]] the LLM can be biased
