Acceptability semantics computes jointly acceptable sets of arguments (extension) - one successful attack has the same effect as several attacks

Gradual semantics is no based on [[Argument Extension|extensions]], but assign a unique score to each argument

Example: 
h-categorizer (Besnard & Hunter, 2001): $deg(a) = \frac{1}{1 + sum(deg(b))}$ such that $b$ are attacks to $a$
